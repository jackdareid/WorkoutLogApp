# WorkoutTracker

WorkoutTracker is a full-stack web application for creating workout programs, logging training sessions, and tracking long-term progress. It was built to demonstrate modern software engineering principles including RESTful API development, JWT authentication, PostgreSQL database design, and scalable application architecture.

This project serves both as a practical fitness application and as a long-term exploration of modern software engineering practices, with a focus on scalable backend development and production-ready architecture.

## Project Status

Active Development

WorkoutTracker is currently under active development. The current release includes user authentication, workout program management, and workout tracking. Upcoming milestones include Docker support, AWS deployment, CI/CD, refresh token authentication, and performance improvements.

---

## Why this project?

I created WorkoutTracker as a long-term engineering project focused on applying production-ready backend development practices. This project will continuously evolve to incorporate technologies such as Docker, AWS, CI/CD, Redis, and automated testing while maintaining clean, maintainable architecture.

## Getting Started

**Note**

The application currently requires a locally hosted PostgreSQL database.
Docker support and deployment are planned in a future release.

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jackdareid/WorkoutLogApp.git
cd WorkoutLogApp
```

2. Install requirements

```bash
cd client
npm install

cd ../backend
npm install
```

3. Set up servers

Open two terminals

Terminal one:

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Terminal two:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

4. Visit website
   http://localhost:5173/
